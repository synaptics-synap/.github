Synaptics Neural Network Acceleration and Processing
----------------------------------------------------

SyNAP is an acronym for *Synaptics Neural Network Acceleration and Processing*. It is a full AI framework support various Synaptics SoCs and is composed of multiple components:

* the `SyNAP documentation <https://syna-synap.github.io/doc>`__
* the `SyNAP toolkit <https://github.com/syna-synap/toolkit/pkgs/container/toolkit>`__
  for TFLite and ONNX model analysis, compilation and conversion
* the SyNAP runtime for the creation of AI application running on AI-enabled Synaptics SoCs
  - the SyNAP secure driver a.k.a SyKURE
  - the SyNAP C++ API for heterogeneous inference and pre- and post-processing
* forks of OpenSource projects optimized for the Synaptics SoCs
